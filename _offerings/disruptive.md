The rules of the game are different and requires a different approach. Talk to us about building dedicated teams to bring your ideas to life, help you create value, protect against unnecessary business risks and transform your business. 

#### Building an Innovation Strategy

You want to become an innovative organisation but you don’t know where to start…

We advise that you kick off with an executive team immersion session, to help you build an Innovation Strategy Mandate and create a Thinking Organisation.

What do you get out of it? Learn to identify the innovation horizons your organisation is facing, how to balance your innovation portfolio, identify areas of growth / innovation opportunities or gaps. Walk away with a hands on approach and actionable plan to drive innovative progress. 


#### Accelerate your Concept

You want to create new disruptive business concepts (outside the standard process) within an accelerated period of time...

We work with you in a high speed innovation environment to transform your business problem into a validated prototype/customer tested solution using our proven Switch innovation processes. 

What do you get out of it? A feasible, viable and desirable solution and MVP business case, which can be used to get additional funding and support from decision makers in your business. 


#### Take your Product to Market 


You have a validated solution and you’re looking for a partner to help you get to market. 

We work with you to develop your business and get your product ready for launch, as a pilot with early adopters. 

What do you get out of it? Support with continued scaling and running of the business taking an agile approach, until you’re ready for it to transition back into business as usual.
